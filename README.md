Hola! I have a Master's degree in Business Analytics (Finance concentration) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My expertise is in **asking the right questions** to stakeholders using which I map the business process flows and data flows. I find these skills to be extremely important for the success of any analytics project. I can wear multiple hats as a Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Analyst and Data Scientist.

I'm passionate about working at the intersection of data and strategy. My previous experience constitutes optimising business processes and refining business strategy using data driven decision making. Furthermore, I have successfully initiated and led multiple data analytics projects in my previous roles.

> I am on a constant journey to learn and make an impact through incisive analytics insights that drive productivity and innovation.
