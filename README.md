# Hi, I'm Abhinay Yarlagadda.

### Technical Lead & Data Scientist | Architecting Research Infrastructure

I build the production systems that power modern research.

As a Technical Lead, I bridge the gap between experimental data science and reliable software engineering. I specialize in the transition from **prototype to production**. I build the critical infrastructure that makes advanced analytics possible. My work spans the entire lifecycle, from designing robust data pipelines to deploying low-latency LLM applications.

Currently, I architect scalable research infrastructure at **Data Science Research Services (DSRS)** at UIUC. I ensure that data initiatives evolve from interesting experiments into secure, reproducible systems.

### 🚀 Engineering Impact

* **Atlas:** Architecting a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine using vector embeddings. The system delivers sub-second semantic search for complex research data.
* **Blockchain Hub:** Engineering ERC-20 smart contracts on the Polygon network. This system tracks internal service delivery and validates research credits.
* **Research Scout:** Developing generative AI agents to synthesize research portfolios and generate dynamic faculty personas.
* **Infrastructure Strategy:** Migrating ad-hoc data workflows into containerized, orchestrated pipelines using Docker, Kubernetes, and Argo Workflows.
